To view the test coverage in the terminal, just run go-carpet.

It works not only in the directory GOPATH. And it works recursively for multiple packages.

With -256colors option, shades of green indicate the level of coverage.

-------

From source:

    go get -u github.com/msoap/go-carpet
    ln -s $GOPATH/bin/go-carpet /usr/local/bin/go-carpet

Download binaries from: [releases](https://github.com/msoap/go-carpet/releases) (OS X/Linux/Windows)

Or install from homebrew (OS X):

    brew tap msoap/tools
    brew install go-carpet
    # update:
    brew update; brew upgrade go-carpet

-----

	go-carpet [-options] [paths]
